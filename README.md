# Satellite Imagery-Based Property Valuation

This project builds a multimodal regression model to predict property prices by combining tabular housing data with satellite imagery.

## Objective
- Predict property prices using numerical features and visual context
- Compare tabular-only vs multimodal models
- Apply explainability techniques to interpret image influence

## Status
 Ongoing
